# PEP 8 - Python Code Style Guide

## Overview
This project focuses on adhering to the **PEP 8** Python code style guide. Following PEP 8 ensures that Python code is readable, maintainable, and consistent, making it easier for teams to collaborate effectively.

The repository contains examples of code refactoring to align with PEP 8 standards, along with guidelines and tools to enforce these practices.
