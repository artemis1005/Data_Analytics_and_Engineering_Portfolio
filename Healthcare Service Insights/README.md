# Course 2: Healthcare Analysis
## Overview
This project analyses healthcare data to identify patterns in appointment durations, regional attendance, and national categories. Sentiment analysis of tweets was also conducted to understand public perception.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and transformation with Python
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Sentiment analysis of text data
- Storytelling through data visualisation

## Key Outputs
1. Python notebook with detailed EDA and sentiment analysis.
2. A report summarising insights and actionable recommendations.
3. A presentation explaining the project and its outcomes.
