# User Defined Functions in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to leverage Python user-defined functions (UDFs) to analyze data efficiently. It focuses on applying UDFs to answer specific business queries for an insurance company client. The analysis revolves around identifying potentially fire-hazardous items in a product catalog.

## Key Use Cases
### Business Scenario
As a data analyst for an insurance company, you are tasked with assessing the risk level of Mr. Smith's merchandise shop due to a surge in fire-related incidents. The analysis focuses on identifying fire-hazardous products using the product descriptions in the dataset.

### Questions Answered:
1. How many products contain the word "Fire" in their description?
2. How many products contain the word "Candle" in their description?
3. How many products contain the word "Matches" in their description?
